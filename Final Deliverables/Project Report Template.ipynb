    "abstract: _This project aimed to develop a logistic regression model to classify the edibility of mushrooms based on 22 secondary characteristics. We have developed 2 models that have achieved sufficiently low FPRs (< 5%) while maintaining satisfactory test accuracy. The initial model included ODOR as the sole predictor after performing EDA on count plots. Although it had a near-perfect performance with 98.5% accuracy and 0% FPR, it was impractical to use by stakeholders due to subjectivity in measurement. After experimenting with subset selection models, we abandoned one-hot encoding or label encoding due to a lack of model interpretability. Eventually, we landed on a final model with 8 predictors, achieving a 96.7% test accuracy and 4.2% FPR. This final model was robust because it provided stakeholders with greater interpretability and less subjectivity. Our stakeholders are recommended to acknowledge the source of the mushroom and to ensure that the observed secondary characteristics align with the categories defined in the dataset. Moreover, the model's low FPR indicates a low probability of misclassifying a poisonous mushroom as edible, which is the most consequential outcome possible. Therefore, it can be effectively utilized in determining the edibility of mushrooms and reducing the risk of mushroom poisoning._.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to <i><a href=\"https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2022/10/misidentification-increases-risk-of-poisoning-as-mushroom-hunters-head-out-to-forage/\">foodsafetynews.net</a></i>, approximately 7,500 people are poisoned by mushrooms each year [1], and with so many varieties it can be hard to know which are edible, and which are not. In order to determine which are safe to consume, we mush evaluate the characteristics that are associated with edibility. Unfortunatley, there is no one easily discernible trait that can be assessed to definitively determine edibility, resulting in the need for a prediction model."

Additionally <b>a chef</b> who has been sent a new mushroom type that they are unfamiliar with to use in a dish may wish to analyze it properly first in order to ensure they will not be poisoning their patrons. And lastly, <b>researchers</b> who discover a new mushroom species with find the model useful as they synthesize information about the mushroom for their report as they likely will want to assess edibility without puting themselves or a research assistant at risk."

    "Following our EDA we found the odor was a strong indicator of whether or not a mushroom was poisonous or edible because odors were either 100% or 0% edible in all but one case where it was ~97% edible. This was constructed as a logit model and was icredibly simple with just one predictor (`poisonous ~ odor`, threshold of 0.5). Despite offering a 98.5% accuracy, 100% precision, and 96.8% recall on our test set, we ultimately found this model to be impractical odor is incredibly subjective and hard to categorize in most scenarios, and a wrong classification of odor would have a devistating effect on the outcome received. \n",

This model, while slightly inferior to the prior model on paper, is significantly more robust, and provides stakeholders with more security in the resonse they get based upon their entries.

    "Due to the constraints of a singular matrix in training our logistic regression model, we decided to use the one-hot encoding method. This technique represents categorical variables numerically in a way that can be easily used in machine learning models. In our dataset, we had 22 categorical variables, each belonging to a finite set of discrete categories. We removed odor, because it is a subjective predictor that's impractical to use, and consequently transformed the remaining ones into 107 predictors in the form of binary vectors. This enables us to use the predictors in our subsequent procedure of subset selection for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculated the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for all 107 predictors and found that a subset of predictors among them had VIFs of infinity, indicating that they suffer from multicollinearity. This result suggests that we must perform feature selection by eliminating some insignificant or highly correlated predictors. Initially, we experimented with forward stepwise selection and found some perfect models with 100% accuracy and 0% false positive rates. However, these perfect models included a large number of predictors, making them difficult to interpret. Despite the flexibility offered by stepwise selection algorithms that allows us to select the best model under different number of features, the \"decent\" model that we have now still has low interpretability. The one-hot encoding method made it nearly impossible for stakeholders to interpret and act on the model in any ways. When visualizing the plot of accuracy against number of predictors and fpr against number of predictors, we found an unusual pattern: while accuracy increases with the number of predictors, fpr doesn't, and has an extremely low rates at around 0-20 predictors. The variables related to Odor might play a role here, but it also suggest that we have a chance of getting fpr really low by using a small subset of predictors. However, again, the corresponding accuracy would suffer, which is also what we don't want to see.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based upon our model, stakeholders should feel relatively confident using it. We achieved a XX% accuracy and XX% recall rate indicating that the model is accurate and has a low false positive rate. A low false positive rate indicates that there is a low probability that the model will predict a mushroom to be edible, when in fact it is poisonous - the most consiquential outcome possible. With this in mind, users should acknowledge the source of the mushroom, as a mushroom growing in an urban environment or out of paved areas are exceedingly likely to be poisonous. Furthermore, for this model to be useful, the interpretation of the secondary characteristics into the potential categories for each, must match that of the data we used. That is, the individual assessing the mushroom must have similar opinion of the classification for each characteristic as the individual responsible for curating the dataset. This is a large source of limitation in our models ability as there is a large potential source of human error. Lastly, accuracy of the data entered for a prediction is crucial as many mushrooms appear nearly identical with only one or two minor distiguishing features. This is the source of collinearity in the model, but also leads to further potential for incorrect result due to poor quality input data."

    "### GitHub Review\n",
    "GitHub provided a consistent method to share files, track progress, and monitor team member contributions throughout the project. While certainly beneficial in these respects, it was not without its difficulties. GitHub was tricky to use for new those in our group inexperienced with it prior to this course, and made traditional efforts in collaboration difficult as only one person could work on the file at a time without large amounts of errors to resolve, and reduced the ability to collaborate side-by-side, as the commits and log history would only reflect the individual who's computer it is on. With all that said, it certainly did streamline to process overall and make it simpler to produce a high quality project."
